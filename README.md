# AIM 
 To simulate a network with Topology, using Cisco Packet Tracer and to verify the connectivity between computer using ICMP.
# EQUIPMENTS REQUIRED
Desktop computer
Cisco Packet Tracer 5.0 Software.


# PROCEDURE
```
STEP 1: Open a Packet Tracer Software.
STEP 2: Drag a 2950 Switch from tool bar and drop it in work area. STEP 3: Drag a PC Terminal from tool bar and drop it in work area. STEP 4: Repeat the Step:3 for four terminals.
STEP 5: Select Copper straight-through cable from tool bar and connect each PC Terminal with 2950 switch in different ports.
STEP 6: Click on the PC Terminal, Select the fast Ethernet Interface from configuration table and set IP address and Subnet mask.
STEP 7: Repeat the Step:6 for all the PC Terminals.
STEP 8: click on the PC Terminal and Select Terminal from the Desktop tab to verify the connectivity between the PC Terminals using Ping Command.
STEP 9: Select “add simple PDU” from tool bar and place it in source and destination PC Terminals to verify the connectivity
